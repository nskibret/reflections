When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When the work requires collaboration with other people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When we pull manually, we choose the branches to that we want. It gives us flexibility in terms of what to pull and what not.
